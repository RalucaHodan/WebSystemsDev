<b><h3> Mad Trivia - Trivia Quiz Game Application</h3></b>

<b>Our reason</h3></b>

Welcome to our journey! We are a team of grad students studying Software Development and Business Information Systems at FEAA, UAIC IASI. By the end of this semester, we will develop an awesome Web application for our Web Systems Development Class.

<b>Description of the application</b>
<p>
  Trivia games are addictive  &
  The solution we are coming up with is to add a fun factor to it, with difficulty levels and various categories of questions. For all the loving trivia people, we will develop the project with JavaScript using Angular Framework, MySQL Database and by using the services of Open Trivia Database API.
Here you will find the design, diagrams, data and an overview of the application.
